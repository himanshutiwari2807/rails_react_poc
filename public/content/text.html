<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The 2020 US Senate elections left partisan control of the chamber in doubt. As votes were counted in the days following the election, Republicans had 50 Senators to the Democrats’ 48, and Joe Biden was the apparent winner of the presidency. The remaining two seats that would decide which party controlled the Senate both resided in Georgia. Because of election rules particular to that state, Georgia’s two Senate incumbents—David Perdue (R) and Kelly Loeffler (R)—were forced to compete in a January 5th, 2021 runoff since neither achieved a bare majority of the vote. Given the importance of party majorities in the modern Congress, especially with the party switch in the presidency, the stakes couldn’t have been higher. The two months leading up to these runoffs were rife with virulent partisanship, heated debates about majority control of the Senate, and tens of millions of additional campaign dollars flooding the state. The level of intense attention paid to these races was unprecedented.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The morning after the runoffs, Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were declared the winners, wiping out the two-seat gap for Democrats and creating an evenly divided Senate in the new Congress. But, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the president of the Senate, Democrats enjoyed a slim but functional legislative majority in the chamber.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite a technical majority, the Senate was evenly divided at 50 Senators apiece. This meant that key questions about how the Senate would be run remained up in the air: How would the parties balance each other on Senate committees? Would the parties split committee chairships? Could individual senators from both parties preside over the Senate during policy debate? Luckily, the parties’ respective Senate leaders—Chuck Schumer (D) and Mitch McConnell (R)—had a helpful blueprint from which they could work. This was not the first time the Senate was split 50/50 between the parties, even in the modern era. Following the also-contentious 2000 election, Democrats and Republicans emerged with an equal number of Senators, with Republican George W. Bush being sworn in as president of the United States.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page129" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="129"></span>As a result, party leaders in the Senate at the time entered into what has come to be called a <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4683">power-sharing agreement</a></b> that resolved questions like those itemized above that arise with an equally split chamber. With newly elected Vice President Dick Cheney (R) serving as the chamber’s tie-breaker, the resulting power-sharing agreement made Republicans the de facto majority party with Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS) serving as Senate Majority Leader. The agreement also stipulated that while both parties would be equally represented on each committee, Republicans would chair all congressional committees as they would in an outright majority. Committee staff and office space would be equally divided between the two parties. Individual senators from both parties would also retain eligibility to preside over the chamber to oversee business as designated by the President Pro Tempore.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the end, the party leadership in the new 117th Congress agreed to a nearly identical power-sharing agreement in the early months of 2021. Adopting a bipartisan agreement like this may seem like an exceptional circumstance in today’s Congress, and in particular for this Congress. Just weeks earlier, a mob of rioters supportive of President Trump stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election, resulting in a ransacking of the very Senate chambers in which majority status had been transferred between the parties. Its adoption came at the end of several months of partisan battles over the election results, conspiracy theories pushed at the highest levels of government, and lingering uncertainty about a Senate majority both parties wanted badly. And yet, the power-sharing episode is emblematic of one of the foundational aspects of Congress as an institution: polarized though they might be, the two major parties are absolutely central to the way Congress is run. What gets put on the floor, how and where policies are developed, and what voting choices are offered and made all revolve around political parties. Business is conducted, arguments are hashed out, and policy is shepherded through (or not) via the organizational structures of the majority and minority parties.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In this chapter, we first examine these organizational structures across the scope of American history, during which the size, nature, geographies, and names of political parties in Congress have evolved continuously. Second, we bring parties into the present by tracking the key changes the parties have undergone that led them to the two-party polarized system we have today. Third, we will use this historical background to explore why parties fail and succeed, as well as how the two parties as organizations specifically and purposefully structure today’s legislative activity in both the House and the Senate. Finally, we narrow the focus to party leaders in Congress and discuss both the immense power they wield and the constraints they face in running the party enterprise in their chambers. In doing so, readers will learn more about the more consequential modern leaders in Congress, how they expanded their influence, and in some cases how they met their eventual demise.</p>

<h1 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Parties in Congress, 1789–1980</h1>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As we’ll discover in more detail later in this chapter, the two major parties heavily structure almost everything about how Congress works on a day-to-day basis. This means not only that the parties are inseparable from the rules and procedures that govern the House and the Senate but also that the parties serve the individual needs of members in important ways. Many of these needs are political. Parties help members raise money, run for reelection, and advocate for a cohesive policy platform that resonates with voters. Party leaders work to provide political cover for individual actions—protection from tough and controversial votes, for example—members may need to take in Washington. The intense polarization between the two parties also serves up ready-made opposition on whom members can blame an inability to get things done. Parties exist to serve the procedural, political, and policy needs of their members and are unlikely to diminish in their influence until they fail to serve this purpose.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Yet despite how much it permeates nearly every aspect of Congress, the two-party system we have today—with its top-down leadership structures, partisan political incentives, and clearly defined ideologies and identities—is a relatively new development in the scope of American history. Parties and partisanship have been central to the operation of Congress for most of its institutional life, but the questions of which parties wield power, how and how much power they wield, and the extent of polarization between them have all varied enormously over nearly 250 years. Parties have risen and fallen, shifted their policies, geographies, and ideologies, and enjoyed differing amounts of loyalty from their members and from the public. These shifts have been far from random. Rather, parties change and even disintegrate when they no longer adequately serve the needs of their members. The results have a significant influence on how Congress works, and the balance of power between and within the two chambers.</p>

<h2 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Early Party Politics in the Founding Generation</h2>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It’s not uncommon to hear some version of the phrase “The founders feared political parties.” There’s a lot of evidence for the statement. Several early major figures in American politics warned Americans about the dangers of parties and partisanship. In his farewell address upon leaving the presidency, George Washington issued an explicit warning “against the baneful effects of the spirit of party,” and that it is in the “interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1973" id="s9781071841471.i1796"><sup>1</sup></a>For many of the founders, parties were not an enabler of better representation, but a direct impediment to it.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Many commentators today are eager to point to these warnings to create one-to-one comparisons between partisanship in the early Republic and what we see occurring in the modern era. But the founders’ supposed disdain for political parties is often misunderstood. James Madison, for example, is well known to have warned against the influence of political parties in the Federalist Papers. But Madison’s partisan nightmare was <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page131" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="131"></span>not two ideologically polarized parties motivated by nationalized policy interests and identities, as we have today. Rather, he feared a multitude of hyperlocal interest group factions that would prevent Americans—and certainly members of Congress—from unifying around a single national interest for the greater good of the country.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1977" id="s9781071841471.i1797"><sup>2</sup></a> For the early congresses in which founders like Madison served, these factions were primarily geographic or economic.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">What is also clear from the decades of political history that followed the Constitutional Convention is that neither Washington nor Madison got their wish for a party-less republic. Even as they and their other high-profile founding colleagues lamented the partisan atmosphere to anybody who would listen, they were constantly engaging in anonymous, yet very public, political warfare that heightened rather than eased these tensions. Even as early as the mid-1790s, two overriding factions had overcome Congress and American politics generally, resulting in the first political parties of the new nation.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4602">Federalists</a></b>, led by Washington’s Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, favored a more central role for the national government and advocated strongly for financial and commercial interests. Federalist strongholds in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast clashed frequently and personally with the Southern faction, which had its own national leader in Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4630">Jeffersonian Republicans</a></b>, as they came to be called, were much more focused on agricultural interests that were (whether they cared to admit it or not) tied in directly with the interest of preserving slavery as an economic and social institution. Before long, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page132" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="132"></span>Hamilton, Jefferson, and their assorted partisan allies in Congress were sniping at each other in the media in attempts to gain leverage over one another, often against the express orders of President Washington, to whom they both were supposed to answer.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The behind-the-scenes machinations of founders like Hamilton and Jefferson give us early insights into the purpose of parties (beyond levying nasty attacks in the media). Both men, along with each of their loyal sets of followers, wanted the fledgling nation to succeed but had difficulty unilaterally implementing their very different ideological visions for realizing that success. The purposeful nature of checks and balances at the federal level, the competing geographic interests, and the lack of organization in early congresses made it clear that no one cabinet member—and certainly no one member of Congress—could institutionalize their policy plans on their own. By finding ideological allies and banding together, the Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans were the first attempts at solving this problem via political parties, whether the founders wanted to call them “parties” or not. By organizing in this way, the early Congress ceased to operate as a divided set of individual representatives, all with competing local factions as Madison had feared. Instead, it came to comprise two or more broader coalitions of these individuals, pushing not hyperlocal interests, but broader agendas agreed upon by the party.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">After the political downfall and deaths of John Adams and Hamilton respectively, the Federalist party sputtered and eventually failed. Jeffersonian Republicans dominated the presidency, resulting in a so-called “<b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4597">Era of Good Feelings</a></b>” (roughly a ten-year period following the War of 1812) defined by less overt partisan conflict due to an unorganized opposition. But the rise of high-profile polarizing figures like Andrew Jackson in the 1820s brought this era to an end and led to new partisan coalitions organized around allegiance alternately to Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and Henry Clay, among others. Parties in Congress quickly shifted during this time along with the fortunes of these major figures, often with little ideological cohesiveness. For example, historical records of party affiliations at this time include names like “Adams-Clay Federalists,” Adams-Clay Republicans, Jackson Republicans, and the rather on-the-nose Anti-Jacksonians. <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1806">Figure 5.1</a> shows us the significant shifting of party allegiances in the antebellum era, as well as some of the prominent national figures who helped organize these factions in Congress and beyond.</p>

Jacksonian and anti-Jacksonian partisanship faded from the halls of Congress as Jackson himself retired from American politics, leading to a several-decade period of substantial partisan change. For a time, leftover Jacksonians morphed into what came to be known as the <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4582">Democratic Party</a></b>, while an assortment of other parties—most notably the <a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4746"><b>Whigs</b></a>, who had their decade in the sun throughout the 1840s—fueled various types of opposition to the Democrats. The ideological orientations of these parties were often mixed, making it difficult for even the Whigs to gain long-lasting traction. This, along with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page133" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="133"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page134" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="134"></span>the long-simmering détente between states that allowed slavery and those that did not, kept consistent two-party politics of the sort we have today out of the House and the Senate—for a time.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Sectional tensions between the North and South, however, soon heated to a boiling point as it became less and less feasible to turn a blind eye to the all-encompassing issue of the enslavement of Black Americans, leading to significant party change in Congress and beyond. The Whigs, led initially by Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, and later by presidents like Zachary Taylor and Millard Filmore, deteriorated as intraparty division on the slavery issue intensified. Progressive Whigs’ combination with other smaller parties led to the rise of a more solidly antislavery Republican Party (though significant intraparty divisions persisted here too, as you’ll discover in this chapter). In Congress, efforts to compromise on the slavery issue in Congress continually fell short or became quickly outdated by the country’s rapid geographic expansion. This occurred largely because of the evolving positions of party factions on efforts to extend (or prohibit) the institution of slavery westward into new states, as well as growing support from Northern “Radical Republicans” in Congress for the outright abolition of slavery. As a result, landmark antebellum legislation like the Missouri Compromise (1820), the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854) was not brokered by well-organized and entrenched partisan coalitions, but rather by long-serving members of Congress like Clay, Webster, John C. Calhoun, and Stephen Douglas.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">These efforts only forestalled the inevitable. Five years of all-out Civil War divided the Democratic Party on sectional lines and resulted in not just war followed by the abolition of slavery, but in a new two-party system of Democrats and Republicans that, at least in name, has persisted to this day. This is a key lesson from the often-shifting party organizations and arrangements during the first 70 years of American politics: even when party coalitions appear to be cohesive, they are highly susceptible to evolving political circumstances and significant societal changes that force adaptation. This is certainly true in Congress, where the urgency of the moment to respond legislatively as the representatives of the people often makes it necessary to re-organize on a new partisan basis. Parties like the Whigs were no doubt successful for a time; they yielded several presidential administrations and had a vast number of adherents in both Congress and the electorate. But their lack of unanimity on the slavery question in one direction or the other led to its irrelevance once the issue could no longer be ignored. As a result, it no longer served members of Congress to adopt the label.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In any event, although the post-Civil War versions of our two major parties were vastly different than the ones we have today, there has been no Congress since that time in which any other party has gained a significant foothold. This was the beginning of the modern two-party system. Still, the influential coalitions, ideologies, and voters <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page135" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="135"></span>who made up these two parties shifted enormously over the course of the ensuing century. <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1812">Figure 5.2</a> tracks the shifting balance of power between the two major parties within the House, as well as the very limited number of third-party lawmakers, from the end of the Civil War up to the present day.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Today’s members of Congress are quite fond of deriding their opposition as “radical,” as if radicalism were a new brand of politics to be avoided at all costs. Regardless of the wisdom of radical ideologies (left, right, or otherwise), radical congressional factions of established political parties are not at all new. The rise and precipitous fall of the so-called “<b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4691">Radical Republicans</a></b>” from the 1850s to the 1870s is an instructive lesson on the influence factions can have, the limits of trying to change congressional parties from within, and the changing legacies these factions undergo as Congress grows and changes.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As the fledging Republicans grew in stature as a free-standing party throughout the 1850s, it quickly became clear that the divisions within the party stemmed not only from trying to fit multiple previous parties (Whig, Free-Soiler, Liberty, etc.) under a single party label but also to enduring ideological differences on the slavery and Reconstruction issues. As a result, the Radical Republican faction of the party banded together on both legislative and representational issues before, during, and after the Civil War as a means of pursuing their antislavery agenda. Their efforts were met with substantial and even violent pushback, including within the halls of Congress itself. In perhaps the best known such instance, abolitionist Senator and Radical Republican Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was caned nearly to death on the floor of the Senate by his colleague, Preston Brooks (D-SC), following what Brooks believed to be incendiary remarks made by Sumner.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page137" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="137"></span>Pushback against the radical faction also took less violent, but no less challenging legislative forms. Even after the secession of the Confederate states in 1861 and the ensuing departure from Congress of dozens of conservative Democrats, the Radicals often found themselves needing to negotiate with moderate Republicans during the war. These moderates were, by and large, more concerned strictly with a peaceful reunion with the South rather than systematically ending Black enslavement. By the time the war had ended and President Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, these differences persisted, particularly in debates over how to reunify with and reconstruct the American South postslavery. Rep. Shelby Cullom (R-IL) put the Radicals’ efforts thusly on the House floor in 1867: “[T]he word Radical as applied to political parties and politicians … means one who is in favor of going to the root of things; who is thoroughly in earnest; who desires that slavery should be abolished, that every disability connected therewith should be obliterated.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1981" id="s9781071841471.i1818"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">These obliterations included the long-term stationing of federal troops in Southern states to enforce voting and civil rights for newly freed African Americans, and requirements for former Confederate sympathizers to take loyalty oaths in order to win back their own voting rights. The radicals found increasing support for these kinds of initiatives, particularly following the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868. Grant did not always define himself as a radical per se, but his public stature, thanks to his Civil War heroics, gave him political leeway to support the radicals when it suited him. The faction controlled key levers of Congress in charge of Reconstruction efforts, including the powerful Joint Committee on Reconstruction that was formed after the war. These efforts resulted in a brief but notable period of significant enfranchisement of freed Black Americans in the south, including the election of the first Black members of Congress.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">But as with many factions, a rise in influence was quickly met with a response from another. The radicals’ politics and policies motivated the formation of a new coalition of more conservative Republicans and Democrats who favored a less active Reconstruction process and reinstated rights for former Confederates, including their military leadership. By the late 1870s, the Radicals had lost control of much of the former Confederacy, beginning a century-long retrenchment of conservative Democratic rule in the South. The troubling and sometimes violent backlash politics of the last quarter of the 19th century were to last for decades, which saw the onset of Jim Crow laws, Black disenfranchisement, and Southern “home rule” in the absence of federal military support. Though the Radical Republicans were, in the scope of American history, a short-lived faction of their party, they exemplified a form of substantive progressive representation in Congress by explicitly advocating for policies that would tangibly advance Black interests. This was particularly important given that descriptive representation (that is, substantial presence and influence of Black legislators in Congress) was, unfortunately, still decades away from that same progress.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page138" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="138"></span>Finally, this factional episode teaches us that our own views of parties and factions change constantly even over relatively short spans of American history. While this faction was seen as deeply “radical” at the time, it espoused views almost nobody would disagree with today, demonstrating that yesterday’s fringe belief is sometimes today’s conventional wisdom. It similarly reflects Americans’ constantly shifting understandings of the meanings of words we use to describe our parties and their coalitional factions. For example, the Radicals’ intraparty opponents were called “Liberal Republicans” despite being notably more conservative on the Reconstruction issue. Rather, these more mainstream Republicans were calling for a return to classical liberalism rather than ideological progressivism. Labels like these can remain confusing even today. As an example, many modern politicians tend to conflate terms like progressive and socialist even when, as we will discover shortly, classical progressives like Teddy Roosevelt were far from socialist. As in all discussions of political history, context is key.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The schism within the Republican Party between conservatives and progressives did not fade following the failure of reconstruction. Instead, their venue of dispute moved toward economic issues as the nation grew and industrialized. Following staggering growth and income inequality throughout the so-called Gilded Age of the late 1800s, Republican progressives, led by President Theodore Roosevelt and made up of members predominantly from the Northeast and Midwest, forged a number of cross-partisan coalitions with populist Democrats to enact progressive economic legislation around trust-busting, labor conditions, and civil service reform. They did so in part by working to weaken more conservative Republican party leaders in Congress like Speakers Thomas Reed and Joseph Cannon, who exerted significant organizational control over the House during the turn of the century. This progressive coalition led to a number of lasting and important changes, including the federal income tax system, and the passage of the 17th and 19th amendments to the Constitution, which provided for the direct election of US Senators (rather than state legislatures), and the universal voting rights for women, respectively.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The progressive coalition in Congress did not last long, however. Roosevelt, despite being the clear national leader of the progressive movement and beloved by most Americans, stuck to his pledge not to run for another term in 1908, passing the mantle to fellow Republican William Howard Taft. Taft’s four years in office, however, found him abandoning much of Roosevelt’s progressive causes, leading to yet another Republican schism between conservative Taft Republicans and progressive Roosevelt Republicans, many of whom splintered off into a new national Progressive Party. And although he came the closest than any third-party candidate in the post-Civil War era to winning the Presidency, Roosevelt fell short in his bid as the <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4687">Progressive Party</a></b> (also known as the “Bull Moose” Party) candidate to reshape American politics around a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page139" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="139"></span>progressive vision. The eventual winner of that election, Democrat Woodrow Wilson, was progressive himself in a number of ways and won in part by peeling away voters from Roosevelt. But the onset of World War I and the increased cooperation between Republican factions in Congress took the wind out of the sails of progressivism, leading to a more conservative status quo throughout the 1920s. Republicans maintained significant majorities during this time and settled into its new position as the more conservative of the two major parties.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This conservative revival was perhaps more short-lived than the progressive one that preceded it largely due to the onset of the Great Depression and the looming World War II conflict throughout the 1930s. In response to a stock market collapse and historic job losses, Americans elected massive Democratic majorities in Congress alongside a new Democratic president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Under Roosevelt’s direction, the new Congress acted quickly and decisively. Roosevelt’s unprecedented “New Deal” legislation responded to the economic crisis by vastly expanding the federal government’s role by investing in jobs programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Civil Works Administration. FDR’s first “100 days” also saw legislative achievements like the Social Security Act and the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. These new initiatives were unprecedented in both scope and scale. The <b>“<a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4655">New Deal coalition</a>”</b> responsible for much of FDR’s agenda included Democratic and Republican liberals from the North, as well as the still-dominant Democrats in the South, thanks to unified support from labor unions and other similar interests.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">After both the war and the Depression had functionally ended, the New Deal coalition remained workable despite a brief interlude of Republican control leading into the Eisenhower Administration. The massive presidential and Congressional response to these crises had yielded Democratic and Republican parties that, although they generally espoused liberal and conservative views respectively, enjoyed substantial ideological overlap. House and Senate leaders in both parties reflected this overlap, which may feel foreign to modern observers of Congress. Eisenhower, the first Republican president in two decades, enjoyed what his former staff called a “remarkably harmonious relationship with Democratic leaders Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1984" id="s9781071841471.i1822"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite enjoying unified government during his first two years in office, Eisenhower noted wryly that leaders within his own party “laughed off platforms as traps to catch voters.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1988" id="s9781071841471.i1823"><sup>5</sup></a> In place of ideologically defined partisanship was the entrenched power of a cadre of senior members of Congress. Conservative Democrats, many of them representing Southern states, dominated entire issue areas and enjoyed key committee chairmanships, enabling them to broker bipartisan legislative achievements and often bottle up legislation they didn’t want to see the floor. As we will see in the next section, this so-called “golden age” of ostensible bipartisanship in Congress wasn’t so golden for Americans of color. And the breaking of the dam brought about by action on civil rights jump-started a polarizing of the two parties that has continued to this day.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A number of crucial factors have worked in tandem to create the polarized two-party system we see in Congress today. The situational politics of the 1960s represented a turning point not just for civil rights and other areas of domestic policy, but for a permanent rearrangement of the two parties with tremendous implications for representation and governance. The two parties were becoming increasingly polarized based on their political ideologies, racial diversity, and geographic locations, among many other characteristics. Descriptors like these all existed prior to the 1960s and were important political identities then as now. What changed was a process called <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4667">partisan sorting</a></b>, in which these and other salient social and ideological identities divided more cleanly along the lines of the two major political parties. Let’s explore these recent historical changes and their implications in more detail.</p>
<section class="sect2" id="s9781071841471.i1828">
<h2 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Coalition Collapse in the 1960s</h2>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Eisenhower era had brought a brief period of relative social ease, mostly brought about by a collective decision to stave off major changes in the area of civil rights. But before long, the “dream” that Martin Luther King, Jr. preached could be comprehensively deferred no longer. Following the <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> decision in 1954 that ordered the desegregation of American schools, and the growing social movements around civil rights, composed of organizations like the Student Nonviolent Coordination Committee (SNCC) and the Freedom Riders. These social movements, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page141" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="141"></span>along with increased pressure from the White House and liberal factions in Congress, resulted in landmark civil rights legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A key feature of this period of intense change was the realization of just how fragile the New Deal coalition of Southern and Northern Democrats was. The fracturing of this coalition was driven in large part by an acknowledgment of the power of Southern Democratic committee chairs in tamping down racial progressivism from the 1930s through the 1950s. Perhaps the most consistent vocalizer of this power imbalance, both in the 1960s and in recent times, was SNCC’s chairman during the heart of the civil rights era, John Lewis, who later became a long-serving member of Congress from his home state of Georgia. Shortly before his passing in 2020, Rep. Lewis, in arguing in support of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, said that “a democracy cannot thrive where power remains unchecked and justice is reserved for a select few.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1991" id="s9781071841471.i1829"><sup>6</sup></a> This sentiment reflected not just the struggle for civil rights, but the fact that the New Deal coalition—for all its legislative achievement on the domestic front in response to economic challenges—had led to centralized power of a faction of Southern conservative Democrats in Congress who had supported these economic priorities partly in exchange for sweeping civil rights issues under the rug.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">As a result of this exposure, the coalition of interests and party factions necessary to make this progress on civil rights significantly scrambled the politics of the New Deal coalition of liberal and conservative Democrats. In the 1960s, core Democratic interest groups like labor unions, faith leaders, civil rights organizations, and public intellectuals teamed with northern liberal Republicans to push through a significant streak of legislative achievement around not only civil rights but also poverty and healthcare that came to be known broadly as the <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4615">Great Society</a></b>. This legislation significantly increased the federal government’s role both in reshaping the American economy and in taking stronger proactive positions on social issues like racial justice. But in revealing the fractures in the original New Deal coalition, the Great Society period was instrumental in pushing the Democratic and Republican parties further apart from each other, both in Congress and in the electorate.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">What do we mean by “further apart”? There are a number of interlocking answers to this question, all related to the central issue of <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4680">political polarization</a></b> between the two major parties in Congress. By this, we mean that Democrats and Republicans no longer have significant overlap with each other as they did in the Eisenhower years. At that time, the parties were mixed in terms of their racial, geographic, and even ideological makeup. Many Democrats, for example, were much more conservative than the most liberal Republicans in Congress. Over time, however, the parties have become more and more different from each other on the basis of these and other key social characteristics. The Republican Party came to be defined more and more as the party <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page142" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="142"></span>of ideological conservatism, rural areas, the South, White racial homogeneity, and the Christian Right; Democrats, meanwhile, dominated among ideologically liberal and urban voters, the two coasts, racial minorities, young people, and progressive White voters. This process, often referred to as “The Big Sort,” happened gradually over the course of several decades and has had profound effects on American political representation and the functions the two parties serve.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1995" id="s9781071841471.i1833"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">An initial lasting effect of the Big Sort on the two parties was on their demographic characteristics, particularly in the crucial identities of race and gender (Table 5.1). In the years following the civil rights era, the small racial gap reflected by Democrats in Congress ballooned into a chasm. In 1966, voters elected a grand total of twelve nonwhite Democratic members of Congress, which still bested the two Republicans in both chambers combined. Exactly 50 years later in the 2016 election, Democrats elected 80 nonwhite members, over 30% of their entire caucus, while Republicans remained in the single digits.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The gender gap has grown similarly and in a shorter time. In the 102nd Congress (1991–1993), women made up 6% and 5% of the Democratic and Republican members respectively in the House and Senate combined; after the 2018 midterms, those numbers were 35% and 8%. Similar descriptive patterns exist in areas like geography, educational attainment, and occupational background. For example, in the 1950s, Democrats had only a slight edge in the share of primarily urban congressional districts. In 2019, over 60% of Democrat-held seats were in urban areas, compared to only 13% of Republican-held seats. In short, the two parties are continually diverging on the basis of multiple identities like race, geography, gender, and religion. Since the parties in Congress continue to look more and more different from each other on most major social characteristics, their lack of common legislative ground may come as little surprise. Political scientists like Lilliana Mason and Julie Wronski have also found that these increasing differences have substantial impacts on voters’ political psychology, leading to more out-group animosity toward the opposing party.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i1998" id="s9781071841471.i1834"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When thinking about today’s Congress, there is one rule of the parties that seems particularly ironclad: the Republican Party dominates in the American South, particularly in the states that had seceded from the Union during the Civil War. But the level of control that Republicans exert over Southern seats in Congress pales in comparison to the near-total levels of representation that the Democratic Party exerted as recently as the 1960s. Conservative Democrats—all of them White—held control of 90% or more of the seats located in formerly Confederate states from the late 1920s through 1960. This was a formidable vestige of the dominance they exerted during the Reconstruction period to beat back efforts on the part of the “Radical Republicans” to integrate the formerly enslaved Black population into Southern society. For a nearly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page143" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="143"></span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page144" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="144"></span>100-year period following Reconstruction, Democrats never relinquished more than 17% of these southern seats.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Things then began to change and quickly. Following the liberal run of Democratic policy achievement in the 1960s, Southern conservatives had had enough. Voters increasingly began to turn to conservative Republican candidates who outflanked Democrats loyal to Lyndon Johnson, a president many voters perceived to have “betrayed” his native South by pressing for desegregation and other purported infringements on states’ rights. Southern Democratic incumbents, seeing the writing on the wall, often opted to retire rather than fight tough reelection battles.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">It wasn’t just a simple matter of replacement, either. In the period between the passage of the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act in the mid-1960s and the beginning of the Obama presidency in 2009, 16 members of Congress formally switched their party affiliation from Democrat to Republican while serving (nearly all representing Southern states), compared to only three who switched in the other direction during the same period (all three from Northern states). These shifts marked the beginnings of the regional <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4716">Southern Realignment</a></b> toward Republicans with which even casual political observers are familiar today.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2001" id="s9781071841471.i1838"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This shifting partisan atmosphere coincided with another crucial change in Southern representation: nonwhite members of Congress. In the period between 1890 and 1962, no more than one Southern member of Congress at a time was nonwhite (most years, it was zero), despite the significant Black population and growing Hispanic population in these states. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, as well as a number of Supreme Court cases that came in the following decades, led to the explicit drawing of majority-minority districts created to ensure descriptive race representation in the South and elsewhere. As they came to be defined as the party of racial diversity in Congress, Democrats of color occupied (and continue to occupy) nearly all of these seats and have consistently since the early 1990s, as <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1840">Figure 5.3</a> shows. In short, the regional sorting that has taken place over the past century is emblematic of two larger forces of political representation at work: the social sorting of the two parties on a host of descriptive characteristics, chief among them race, gender, and geography; and the slowly growing racial diversity of Congress, particularly within the Democratic Party.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In 1950, the heyday of the New Deal coalition, the American Political Science Association (APSA) published a landmark report entitled “Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System.” By “responsible,” APSA did not mean that the parties should govern in a more trustworthy or mature manner, though this would have been a bonus. Rather, they meant that in their current state, the Democratic and Republican parties had become electorally unaccountable to the voters. By colluding to preserve regional or group-specific policy interests, the panel charged, the parties were too ideologically <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page145" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="145"></span>similar. Both contained a significant mix of liberal and conservative viewpoints in Congress and other elected institutions, and as a result, voters could not reasonably tell the difference between the two. In order for voters to be able to hold liberal or conservative policies accountable at the ballot box, they needed to be presented with two or more clearly differentiated—and even ideologically polarized policy platforms. Doing so would empower voters to reward the platforms and policies they believed had worked, and punish those that did not. Only then could the parties serve their representational purpose. This traditional view of how parties should form—based on differentiated ideological policy visions—is what has come to be known as the <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4699">“Responsible Parties” Theory</a></b>.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2004" id="s9781071841471.i1844"><sup>10</sup></a> Historically, the New Deal coalition produced significant legislative accomplishments in Congress in the wake of the Great Depression, but in a way that left many voters (primarily voters of color) behind, and—in APSA’s view—did not serve them well by presenting them with clearly defined party platforms.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Since the APSA report, however, the social and geographic sorting, as well as the polarizing Great Society policymaking of the 1960s, made it much clearer which party believed what. Each party’s mix of liberal and conservative ideologies that APSA lamented quickly dissipated, leaving a primarily liberal Democratic Party and a primarily conservative Republican Party. The rigid platforms that Eisenhower’s congressional rivals had laughed off as fungible documents quickly became two highly polarized doctrines of how government should operate. The Congress that emerged following the collapse of the New Deal <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page146" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="146"></span>coalition and extending through the modern era is one that has lived up to, and well past, APSA’s suggestion of presenting a clear and polarized choice to the people.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When taken together, these developments have had seismic impacts on how members of Congress represent their constituents, primarily by reshaping how they are incentivized to behave legislatively. Thanks to a combination of geographic sorting and partisan gerrymandering, legislators throughout the Big Sort came to occupy seats in both the House and the Senate that were increasingly electorally safe for their party. As a result, the district-level and statewide constituencies members needed to satisfy in order to win reelection were increasingly, and nearly uniformly, voters from their own party rather than the opposition. Put another way, voters were increasingly assessing their representatives based on how loyal they were to a cohesive party line on the issues important to the parties’ divergent constituencies. And as the dividing lines brought about by the Big Sort became clearer, so too did the motivations for rank-and-file members of Congress to support their party’s agenda rather than cross the aisle legislatively. The combined forces of ideological and social sorting in both the electorate and those who represented them fundamentally changed the incentive structure around roll-call voting in Congress, with Democrats expected to vote for the liberal position and Republicans for the conservative one on any given piece of legislation. <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1847">Figure 5.4</a> demonstrates that the two parties in Congress have come to vote in an increasingly ideologically polarized way, a phenomenon we will address in more detail in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i2380.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

The parties themselves, as well as their ideological orientations and the demographic constituencies that make them up, have changed enormously during our history. One relative constant in the modern Congress, however, is how integral the parties as collective entities are to how Congress functions. By serving the political and policy needs of their members which they cannot accomplish on their own, parties are absolutely essential to the operation of the legislative branch. We begin, though, by reviewing the key historical changes we’ve just covered through the lens of key political science theories as to why parties exist, as well as why, when, and how they fail.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">We’ve observed that as Congress has evolved, it has seen the formation and collapse of a number of political parties with divergent goals and motivations. Understanding the development and importance of party organization in Congress requires first that we understand how and why parties exist. In modern times, parties are often viewed as frustrating impediments to policymaking, obsessed with scoring political points and creating unprecedented gridlock. However, as a number of different theories posit, parties are (or at least, can be) crucial tools that organize the interests and viewpoints of a far-flung, increasingly diverse, and still-growing nation. As a result, our two major parties have become the primary mechanism by which policy representation happens in Congress. Why? What problems do healthy political parties help to solve in Congress? What problems do unhealthy political parties create? The historical partisan shifts in Congress that we’ve just discussed offer some instructive answers to these questions.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">First, the failures of the founding generation to live up to their nonpartisan promises tell us a great deal about why political parties are created and how they fail. One traditional theory about why parties exist centers around their utility and productive capacity in institutions like Congress. In his seminal work <i>Why Parties?</i>, John Aldrich posited that parties become necessary when <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4561">collective action problems</a></b> arise. Aldrich argued that parties were organizations designed specifically to address problems that a single person (that is, a single member of Congress) alone cannot solve. Members need a way to band together into coalitions, organize their belief systems, and act in concert on legislative priorities. As powerful as a founding titan like Hamilton was with his powers to persuade and command of the written word, he had little formal power outside of the cabinet room without an organized faction acting with unanimity in an effort to sway public opinion and of course to influence Congress to act in his interests.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="148"></span>In his aforementioned farewell address, George Washington articulated another useful but cynical theory of parties that has persisted to this day: that “the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2007" id="s9781071841471.i1852"><sup>11</sup></a> In other words, political parties are not grand representational aggregators of opinion and interest in the citizenry. Instead, they are little more than power mechanisms through which ambitious politicians channel their personal or localized interests, at the expense of the broader national interest. They are merely the tools of elites, who have their own goals that may or may not align with the goals of those who have been elected to serve. This is to some extent the case in Congress, where individual members often use their positions within the party structure to effect change for themselves or their constituents. We have already learned that this theory is applicable to congressional elections, where candidates often coast to reelection based largely on their party label.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">History also tells us that parties in Congress can also be defined by allegiance to a particular person, leading to breakdowns <i>within</i> parties as well as <i>between</i> them. Recall that prior to the Civil War, party factions scrambled to find cohesion through national voices like Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, or John Quincy Adams. These breakdowns and subsequent attachments to charismatic leaders tend to happen when the coalition underlying that party is weak or fractured. This type of intra- and cross-party breakdown may sound familiar to us even in the modern era. Following his electoral defeat in the 2020 election, President Donald Trump has continued to divide the Republican Party in Congress, particularly in light of his second impeachment following the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters aiming to overturn the results of the election. As a result, differences between Republican members of Congress within their party conferences were often defined much less by ideological conservatism or moderation, but rather by fealty to the former president and his nontraditional, often nonideological worldview.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Finally, other more modern theories feature interest groups as key to understanding how parties solve Congress’s collective action problems. In her work with coauthors, Kathleen Bawn posited that parties are often formed by coalitions of interest groups, or “policy demanders.” In this view, parties are not primarily driven by strictly ambitious politicians, or even by strictly-adhered-to ideological purity. Rather, parties are formed when groups of organized interests band together, even in the absence of common belief systems, in order to achieve more together than what they could alone. Parties collapse (or at least weaken) when the coalition of interests that held them together no longer serves the collective interests of all of its composite groups. This theory helps us to explain, for example, how Democrats achieved so many legislative accomplishments during the New Deal era. Long-serving Southern Democrats, many of them chairs of powerful committees, oftentimes allowed the passage of far-reaching economic programs they did not favor ideologically, in exchange for which the rest of the coalition permitted the continuance of white hegemony and segregation in the South.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="149"></span>The theory also helps explain how the coalition fell apart following the Great Society and civil rights eras, which saw the reunifications of Republicans around a conservative social and economic ideology and a realignment of the South away from the Democrats. The party coalition of which these same Southern Democrats were a part no longer served their interests of racial conservatism and segregation, forcing them to either switch parties or fade into obscurity. As the Democrats came to be viewed as the party of civil rights, and Republicans the party of moral conservatism, groups like African Americans and the Christian Right followed suit respectively. The new two-party system, and the interest group coalitions that came to make them up, served them better. Both historically and currently, it is this underlying purpose that endows parties in Congress with structural power.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One underlying truth in common with many of the historical partisan changes is that whatever form in which they appear, parties have always been—and will likely continue to be—crucial for shaping the culture, procedure, and power structure in Congress. When we think of a political party, we may think of a particular individual, like the president or a prominent senator. We may also think of issue platforms or activists that are associated with one party or the other, or perhaps even the dramatic partisan flair from a modern party nominating convention. These are all important lenses through which we should analyze and understand today’s political parties, and we will do so in later chapters. But in Congress, it is necessary to first think about parties as actual organized groups of members, each with practical and tactical influence over the institution. The two parties are crucial to the day-to-day functioning and provide much of the actual nuts-and-bolts structure for how Congress works.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">First and foremost, the balance of the two parties within each chamber determines which party is in the majority and which is in the minority. Apart from giving one side a tactical and numerical advantage on floor or committee votes, majority status dictates much of the daily activity in both chambers, including how and when legislative business is conducted. For example, the majority can, with some restrictions, change or even suspend the rules of the chamber to suit their party’s agenda, as is detailed in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i2380.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>. Committee assignments are also made on a partisan basis, with the majority and the minority each in charge of their own assignments (though the majority notably gets more seats on these committees). Generally, the majority controls the scheduling of bill considerations and votes, as well as other daily chamber business. Relatedly, parties play significant roles in electing the leadership in each chamber, which will be described in more detail later in this chapter. In summary, we can see that the two parties—and particularly their status as the majority or minority party—are not only significant players in our political culture, but intertwine operationally with various subinstitutions like committees, chamber leadership, and legislative rules and procedure.</p>

These efforts happen on an informal basis, with party leaders and their allies working with, and occasionally pressuring, rank-and-file party members in order to further the agenda. However, the two parties also meet regularly on their own through what is called the <a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4669"><b>party caucus (for Democrats) or conference (for Republicans)</b></a>. Under the direction of the caucus chair, party members in the House and Senate respectively meet on a regular basis under one roof to discuss legislative strategy, enforce unity within the caucus air policy positions and grievances, and work to ensure collective action among most or all members in order to further the party agenda.</p>

In practice, these varying theories of partisan influence are either working in tandem or become alternately important at different times depending on political conditions in Congress. Let’s explore a few of them.</p>
<section class="sect3" id="s9781071841471.i1857">
<h3 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Conditional Party Government Theory</h3>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Political scientists have an evolving understanding of what drives party activity in Congress, but most theories center on which of Congress’s subinstitutions—committees, leaders, or parties themselves, for example—have power relative to others. One perspective is that the two parties in Congress are not always the powerful entities many assume them to be. Instead, they only succeed in driving the congressional policymaking agenda when certain conditions are met: namely, when the majority is relatively unified and ideologically cohesive and when the majority and minority parties are polarized on major policy issues. When these conditions are met, majorities exercise <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4681">positive agenda control</a></b> in that they use their cohesive majority to pass their partisan agenda through the legislative process and turn their priorities into law. This is, in essence, Aldrich and Rohde’s <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4730">theory of Conditional Party Government</a></b>.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2010" id="s9781071841471.i1860"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The logic of conditional party government is relatively clear: if rank-and-file members of Congress fall closely in line with the party platform, they are more likely to cede their policymaking authority to party leaders. Because they are largely in agreement on which direction they want to go, they are willing to defer to their leaders to negotiate on their behalf. When this happens, major legislation can be passed that serves the party’s agenda largely because the majority party is united in their desire to push it forward. For example, the 2018 tax reform legislation was pushed through by a relatively united Republican conference in the House and Senate, as did the 2021 party-line votes on the Democratic side for President Biden’s COVID-19 relief <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="151"></span>package. In short, parties use their power specifically to proactively achieve legislative victories on their agenda, conditional on party unity and polarized preferences from the other side. This is the most common form Conditional Party Government theory takes today. On the other hand, when there is internal party disagreement on an issue, lawmakers are less willing to let their leaders speak on their behalf; they would much rather speak for themselves to ensure their opinions are registered. If the parties are disorganized, ideologically diffuse, and overlap considerably with each other on policy, power may devolve away from parties and their leaders, and toward nonleader lawmakers, and entrepreneurial legislators who work across the aisle, for example.</p>

Under <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4668">Party Cartel Theory</a></b>, originally put forward by Gary Cox and Matthew McCubbins, leaders of the majority party act as a unified team, or “cartel,” and use procedural tools to set the legislative agenda explicitly for the benefit of the members of the majority party. In practice, this means not just pushing forward items using positive agenda control but also regularly preventing legislation and issues from reaching the floor which is either unpopular with the majority or where there is intraparty disagreement. This effort to screen legislation that does not achieve unified partisan ends is known as <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4654">negative agenda control</a></b> because leaders use their agenda-setting powers to keep things off of the floor.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2013" id="s9781071841471.i1864"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

But negative agenda control can take a few different forms. These can be bills introduced by the minority which obviously have no chance of passage: for example, bills introduced by Democrats during periods of Republican control that establish statehood for Washington, DC. In this case, Republican leaders understand that this bill has little to no support in their caucus; why put it on the floor for a vote? However, negative agenda control is even used by party leaders for legislation that has the support of substantial contingents of their own caucus, if they believe that the bill would either fail or cause significant electoral problems for key rank-and-file members. Following President Trump’s rescission of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, for example, Republicans in Congress were divided on whether to pass the DREAM Act, which would reinstate it legislatively. Trump had indicated this was the approach he wanted, but drew rebukes from the right wing, with Breitbart, in particular, labeling him “Amnesty Don.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2016" id="s9781071841471.i1865"><sup>14</sup></a> Republican leaders, fearing similar rebukes for their more vulnerable members, backed off, leaving the DREAM Act in limbo even though it very well may have passed on an up-or-down vote. In short, party leaders use the principles of party cartel theory to protect their members from difficult votes, as well as to enforce ostensible party unity from the top down. We will discuss this variety of detailed but crucial procedures further in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i2380.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">More modern theories of party activity in Congress are not incompatible with either Conditional Party Government or Party Cartel Theory. Rather, they tend to emphasize analyzing parties in Congress through the lens of elections. Specifically, how do current and future electoral conditions dictate what the majority and minority parties do collectively to achieve electoral priorities, even at the expense of some of their policy priorities? The previous section made it clear why a party should want to be in the majority: even beyond the simple numerical advantage, the extensive set of legislative powers and positioning offered by majority status alone seems worth the significant effort made to win it every two years.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">But for a significant period of the 20th century, no amount of effort on the part of the Republicans seemed likely to change their status as a semipermanent minority in Congress. From 1933 until 1980, there were only two congresses that put Democrats in the minority. Most notably, the Democratic Party did not yield its majority in the House until 1995 after forty years of uninterrupted rule. Eight presidential administrations had come and gone with a Democratic-controlled House for the entire duration. Foreign as this condition may be to our modern era where majority status flips back-and-forth on a near-constant basis, these figures make it plain why Republicans had for decades simply given up on winning the majority.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">What policymaking incentives result from these two opposite conditions: one in which chamber majorities seem permanently out of reach for one of the two parties, and our modern condition, in which majority status is constantly up for grabs? For Republicans during the era of Democrat domination, the way forward was clear. If the majority is out of reach anyway, working with the other side is the only way the Republicans could achieve any of their legislative priorities. Compromise was the goal. In the modern era, this incentive structure has been upended. Why help the majority push through its agenda when you can just win it back in two short years? In fact, parties in Congress have made the calculation that compromising on issues can detract from a party’s message for why they deserve to be returned to the majority.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2020" id="s9781071841471.i1868"><sup>15</sup></a> Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole (R) perhaps summed it up best in describing his party’s positioning following the 2020 election: “The job of the majority is to govern; The job of the minority is to become the majority.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2023" id="s9781071841471.i1869"><sup>16</sup></a> As we’ll explain further in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i2380.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, this incentive structure helps to explain why today’s era of partisan legislative gridlock is actually electorally rational, despite it resulting in few legislative compromises.</p>

<h2 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Intraparty Divisions</h2>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In many ways, and for a number of reasons we’ve discussed, parties are designed to promote unity and solve the collective action problem of legislating in Congress. However, schisms often occur on an intraparty basis (that is, between groups within a single party) that can significantly shape the way Congress functions and conditions the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page153" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="153"></span>power a majority (or a minority) can wield in the policymaking process. As we saw with the Radical Republicans in the post-Civil War era, these divisions can have significant impacts on substantive policy outcomes, the ideological orientation of the party, and the manner in which parties serve as vehicles of representation for the subgroups that make them up.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Some intraparty divisions are primarily ideological. In the 2018 midterm elections, for example, two senators in the Democratic Caucus, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, both won reelection. Sanders, who unabashedly identifies as a democratic socialist, is perhaps the best-known national leader of the modern progressive movement. Sanders is known in part for his advocacy for the Green New Deal, a sweeping progressive proposal designed explicitly to expand the federal government’s involvement in mitigating the effects of climate change. Manchin, on the other hand, is the Senate’s most conservative Democrat and represents a state that voted nearly 70% in favor of a second term for President Trump. Manchin ran for his first election to the Senate in 2010 on the explicit promise that he would sideline any effort to interfere with the fossil fuel industry. In one ad, Manchin famously aimed a shotgun at a copy of the so-called “cap-and-trade” legislation Congress was then considering in order to deal with the climate issue. The legislation Manchin blew to smithereens was considerably more conservative than any iteration of the Green New Deal that has been proposed to date. That Manchin and Sanders both remain loyal soldiers to the same party speaks both to the ideological tensions that can exist within parties and the significant power parties have to overcome them.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">These divisions often take place on the basis of presidential loyalty. In early 2021, Republicans in Congress faced a challenging political situation, having lost the presidency, and their majorities in both the House and the Senate. The situation was made more challenging when the outgoing Republican president, Donald Trump, was charged with his second set of impeachment articles as a result of his alleged role in inciting the mob who stormed the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. Unlike Trump’s first impeachment, multiple Republicans in both chambers crossed party lines to impeach the president. Even though the Senate decided not to convict Trump, their attempt was met with swift retribution from Republican voters and members of Congress loyal to the former President. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA), in explaining his vote, said “I voted to convict former President Trump because he is guilty. That’s what the facts demand… I have no illusions that this is a popular decision.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2027" id="s9781071841471.i1872"><sup>17</sup></a> It wasn’t. Cassidy and several other Republican senators who voted to convict the former president faced calls for their resignation from their own local party organizations in their home states. On the House side, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican Party’s conference chair, faced a revolt from even her fellow Republican House members who called for her to be removed from her leadership post. Although she originally survived a vote to replace her as conference chair in an intraparty vote taken shortly after the impeachment trial, Trump-loyal House Republicans like Rep. Matt Gaetz (FL) helped <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="154"></span>organize protests in Cheney’s home state against her leadership. She was eventually deposed a few months later after continually voicing concerns about former President Trump’s false assertions that the 2020 election was “stolen.” And in August 2022, Cheney lost her seat after being primaried by a Trump-back challenger.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Whatever the reasons for intraparty divisions, they can wreak significant havoc within a party’s caucus. For the majority, intraparty fractures can slow down or even derail its legislative agenda. By the same token, conflict within the minority can hamper its efforts to achieve its own ultimate goal, as Rep. Cole described: becoming the majority. Regardless of majority status, the theories of party influence that we have discussed have made clear the value parties can have in creating cohesive, unified fronts of legislative and representational action. In the next section, we’ll observe how party leaders use every tool at their disposal to enforce that unity and keep Congress operational.</p>

For a number of reasons, the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader, and other party officials in both chambers have amassed a significant amount of power in the most recent period of institutional change in Congress. This makes the story of how parties structure representation and lawmaking on Capitol Hill impossible to tell without an understanding of who leaders are, where their power comes from, and the leadership styles they use to impose their will. In <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i854.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, we discussed the job descriptions of the chamber leaders depicted below in <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1878">Figure 5.5</a>.</p>

Party leaders are essential to legislative operation in Congress based not just on their formal positions, but the immense procedural and political powers provided to them by their rank and file members. These powers range in their scope and type. Some are formal and built into the rules and procedures of the House and Senate. Others are informal and involve the advantages of resources—both political and informational—that come with the job. While they are not invulnerable, party leaders leverage both sets of advantages in order to maintain control over the legislative bodies they run.</p>
<section class="sect2" id="s9781071841471.i1880">
<h2 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Formal Chamber Powers</h2>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The first and most tangible way in which party leaders maintain control is by controlling the flow of business in their chambers. In the House, the speaker has the power <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="155"></span>to either recognize or ignore individual members who wish to bring something up for debate or to vote on the floor. This is a very specific example of negative agenda control in action: silencing members in both the majority and the minority from bringing up issues that are not in the interest of the leadership or their party as a whole. Leaders in both the House and the Senate also decide on the congressional schedule, including when their chambers can be called into recess, and sometimes just as importantly, when they can be called back in an emergency. In early 2021, for example, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), blocked Democrats’ efforts to call the Senate into an emergency session prior to Inauguration Day in order to hold a trial on the articles of impeachment for President Trump that had just passed the House of Representatives.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2038" id="s9781071841471.i1881"><sup>20</sup></a> In shutting down this option, McConnell delayed the trial and ensured it would take place after Trump left office, essentially offering his fellow Republican Senators a ready-made excuse for voting against conviction: that since Trump was no longer the president, removal and conviction were unnecessary.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">An additional formal power of leaders is to do special legislative favors for rank-and-file members to retain their support using discrete forms of agenda control. For example, leaders can allow a member’s pet piece of legislation, no matter how substantively insignificant, to get recognition for discussion or a vote either on the floor or in a key committee. For rank-and-file members, being seen as taking action on these issues is often invaluable evidence to their constituents for a member’s representational heroics in Washington. Leaders also have a number of less formal but still internally important roles and titles they can dole out to members to win their loyalty. Positions on international congressional fact-finding missions called CODELs, or quasi-leadership <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="156"></span>posts like the manager of a presidential impeachment process, for example, might be valuable for members looking to beef up their foreign policy credentials or step into the partisan limelight.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Party leaders also have significant control over congressional committees, despite rarely having specified seats on them. While party leaders cannot technically appoint members to committees or control committee activity unilaterally, we see in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml">Chapter 5</a> that they have significant influence over these processes and often use it to their political advantage or as a mechanism to incentivize partisan loyalty. The Speaker of the House, for example, can designate which committee is the primary committee during the multiple referral process for new legislation or set time deadlines for a committee to act on a bill. Perhaps most consequentially, they are also in charge of appointing members to conference committees, which are used to reconcile differences between similar legislation passed simultaneously through the House and Senate. This gives them influence not only over the members on these committees but also the substance and quality of the legislation that is brought up and discussed in these venues.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Exerting control over such technical (and even, by appearances, mundane) procedural matters on and off the floor may seem unimportant, but it’s quite the opposite. Many if not most rank-and-file members of Congress have significantly less institutional experience and therefore lack an encyclopedic knowledge of the legislative process. They also have, as we have discussed, a limited number of trusted staffers, and far more to do than time in which to do it. This significant power imbalance allows party leaders to maintain both the positive and the negative agenda control mechanisms that we discussed earlier in this chapter. Leaders can marshal their institutional levers of power toward accomplishing a particular party agenda priority, for example, by appointing loyal members to a committee where swift action on one of their priorities is essential. On the flip side, leaders can use their perches to studiously ignore members passionate about issues that divide the party, thereby keeping these troublesome items off the congressional agenda.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">While the second type of chamber control leveraged by party leaders in Congress is both more informal and takes place largely out of the public eye, it is every bit as crucial to their political and legislative success. These informal advantages go hand-in-hand with the unique challenge leaders are tasked with overcoming: the unification of their caucus or conference around the party’s agenda and keeping rank-and-file members on board. Parties, as we discussed earlier, are designed to solve problems of collective legislative action in Congress. But in a nation as sprawling and diverse as the United States, doing this with only two parties does not happen on its own. The more tools party leaders have available to keep their members loyal, the greater success they can achieve as a party.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">First, it is crucial for leaders to understand the constellation of demands that rank-and-file legislators face both at home and in Washington so they can be there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="157"></span>to help fulfill those demands in exchange for loyalty to the party. Not all members require the same demands met in order to be brought on board in support of the party’s initiatives. Some concerns are ideological; others are much more tangible, like a policy crisis particular to a district or region. If attention or policy action can be promised on these items, perhaps the member representing that region will agree to support other legislative priorities they might not have otherwise. In order to exert maximum cohesion within their caucus, party leaders and whips must understand which members are motivated by policy attention or broader ideological concerns; which constituencies members require the support to win reelection in their state or district; and which institutional perks are available to dole out to members as rewards for party loyalty.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">These perks include plum committee assignments, a process over which party leaders have significant if not autocratic influence. They also include more tangible rewards for loyalty. For many years, targeted appropriations referred to as <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4594">earmarks</a></b> were a crucial tool used by party leaders to win the support of withholding rank-and-file members for key legislation. By using the appropriations process to ensure that a crucial piece of infrastructure was built in a House member’s district, for example, the fence-sitting member can afford politically to take a difficult vote if they can show their constituents that doing so was in their best interest. Earmarks faced a decade-long ban starting in January of 2011 when the newly elected Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) eliminated the practice with backing from his Republican colleagues, as well as Democratic President Barack Obama, in the name of transparency and pushing back against “special interests.” Before long, however, party leaders realized that keeping earmarks and other policy favors in their back pockets as means of directing the legislative behavior of their caucuses made their jobs significantly easier; earmarks—officially renamed community project funding—were formally reinstated at the beginning of the 117th Congress in 2021, with the tacit approval of both Republicans and Democrats.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2042" id="s9781071841471.i1885"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Party leaders in both houses of Congress also wield significant control over less visible resources that are crucial to the legislative success of rank-and-file members. One such resource is information, particularly about major legislation on the party agenda. In his book, <i>Legislating In The Dark</i>, political scientist James Curry demonstrates not only that rank-and-file members of Congress are often forced to rely on information and cues that come solely from party leadership but also that this is done by design to enhance leaders’ power. “Congressional leaders,” Curry argues, “are able to emphasize or bury particular items, exploiting their information advantage to push the legislative agenda in directions that they and their party prefer.” By keeping rank-and-file members in the dark until the last minute, congressional leaders make sure that their members do not have enough independent time, staff, and other informational resources to figure out which parts of a bill they object to and fall in line to support it as a result. Since the New Deal, the congressional issue agenda has grown exponentially along with the size, scope, and complexity of major legislative initiatives. So, too, has the ability of party leaders to control the flow of information to their rank-and-file, and as a result their own unilateral control over the process.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2046" id="s9781071841471.i1886"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="158"></span>A final informal resource that party leaders have at their disposal is money, specifically fundraising prowess and the ability to direct these campaign funds to vulnerable members. Party leaders often do this indirectly, by directing the redistribution of excess campaign funds from members of their caucus in electorally safe districts toward their more vulnerable members. It is often, however, more direct than that. As nationally known political figures, party leaders can hold lavish fundraisers, either for particular candidates or to directly fund their own <b><a class="glossary-link" href="s9781071841471.i4521.xhtml#s9781071841471.i4635">leadership PACs</a></b>. These PACs are specifically designed to help leaders gain seats in their legislative chamber, and accordingly have grown exponentially in their fundraising hauls over the years (see <a class="fig-link" href="s9781071841471.i1783.xhtml#s9781071841471.i1890">Figure 5.6</a>). Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) “PAC to the Future,” for example, raised nearly $12 million alone in the 2020 elections to protect her chamber’s majority.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2049" id="s9781071841471.i1889"><sup>23</sup></a> And leaders’ electoral influence doesn’t stop there. Party leaders also have formidable sway over the makeup of the party’s congressional campaign committees. This further extends leaders’ influence far beyond Capitol Hill and into activities like candidate recruitment and campaign messaging that matter enormously for their chances of winning and retaining the majority in their chamber.</p>

By occupying the top of the food chain in their respective chambers, these leaders are usually among the best-known national politicians in the countries, and (as we will learn in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i2380.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>) play very public roles in the policymaking process. For example, party leaders often play the role of chief legislative antagonist to the President if they are a member of the opposing party. This is a very familiar paradigm in the Congress of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="159"></span>last thirty years, which saw Newt Gingrich (R-GA) butt heads with President Clinton, John Boehner (R-OH) and Mitch McConnell (R-KY) with President Obama, and Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) with Republican Presidents Bush and Trump. Conversely, as we will discuss further in <a class="link" href="s9781071841471.i3066.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, leaders in both the House and Senate serve as legislative branch partners with a president of the same party. As vociferous as Speaker Pelosi was in her antagonism toward President Trump, for example, she worked just as hard with Presidents Obama and Biden to pass a number of sweeping Democratic priorities in the 111th and 117th Congresses, including the Affordable Care Act in 2010.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">While most or all modern party leaders in Congress have had access to these various means of retaining control over their party members, not all have used them in quite the same way. Similar to the presidency, personality and political circumstances can greatly impact how leaders use the resources of their office. The differing leadership styles exhibited by Newt Gingrich, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitch McConnell are, when taken together, emblematic of the modern leader-driven Congress. While they varied in their tactics and levels of success, all three used the tools available to them—and even created a few others—to exert maximum control relative to other congressional power centers like committee chairs or cross-partisan coalitions. Over the past thirty years, these three titans of Congress completely changed the style and manner in which these powers were used to further their party’s agenda in an era of slim majorities and extreme polarization. Understanding their successes (and failures) is crucial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page160" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="160"></span>to a broader understanding of the role leaders and the parties they run play in how Congress represents and legislates in the modern era.</p>

<h3 class="title" xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The Troublemaker: Newt Gingrich</h3>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Years after his tumultuous speakership culminated in his resignation, Newt Gingrich (R-GA) appears to revel in the controversial titles ascribed to him. “The Man Who Broke Politics,” blares one headline in a Gingrich profile in <i>The Atlantic</i>.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2053" id="s9781071841471.i1898"><sup>24</sup></a> Another describes his methods as <i>Burning Down the House</i>.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2057" id="s9781071841471.i1899"><sup>25</sup></a> But long before Gingrich was a political commentator, presidential candidate, or even Speaker of the House, one quotation from his first campaign for the House suggests that these may not be inaccurate descriptors. “One of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don’t encourage you to be nasty,” Gingrich told a group of College Republicans in 1978. We encourage you to be neat, obedient, and loyal, and faithful, and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around the campfire but are lousy in politics. In order to be successful in politics, he told these youngsters, they needed to “raise hell. Raise hell all the time.”<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2060" id="s9781071841471.i1900"><sup>26</sup></a> Gingrich certainly did once he got to Washington, leading a group of young House conservatives that developed the modern Republican Party agenda in Congress into a more aggressive, activist one that directly challenged the long-dominant Democrats.<a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2064" id="s9781071841471.i1901"><sup>27</sup></a> Upon raising his national profile, Gingrich rose through the ranks and developed with other Republican leaders in the minority a Contract With America platform, promising a sharply confrontational and distinct alternative to Democratic policies in an effort to unite Republicans and win back the majority for the first time in forty years.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Gingrich’s strategy worked. Republicans took control of the House for the first time in decades in 1995, and Newt was rewarded for his electoral vision by being named Speaker. According to a TIME magazine profile in which he was named 1995’s “Man of the Year,” Gingrich and his midterm election efforts had “changed the center of gravity in the nation’s capital.” This was no doubt the case, but Gingrich’s influence went beyond politics and into the internal machinations of how parties operated within the House of Representatives. The new Speaker became and remains responsible for one of the major rearrangements of power within the chamber in the modern era: significantly empowering party leaders, namely the speaker, at the expense of committees and their chairs. Gingrich cut the number of committees (and their staffs) by 1/3 in the name of shrinking the government. Not only did Gingrich institute a six-year term limit on chairmen, thus making impossible the dominant careers of powerful Southern Democrats of the mid-20th century, but he also led the creation of a new steering committee with built-in powers for party leadership, giving them outsized influence in the committee assignment process. These committee-related changes, as well as increased use of appropriations earmarks, grew the power of party leaders to new heights and marked the beginning of the modern, leader-powered chambers we have today. Gingrich’s meteoric rise to Speaker of the House fell just as quickly. Amid ethics charges over tax violations, poor handling of the mid-1990s government <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page161" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="161"></span>shutdown and the Clinton–Lewinsky impeachment, and a leadership challenge from other major players in his own party, Gingrich resigned the speakership in 1999.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Gingrich burned brightly and burned out just as quickly. But his marks on both American politics and the leadership structures in Congress are indelible and twofold. His willingness to leverage new institutional tools, like a heavy hand in committee assignments, opened the door for future leaders to exercise these powers more flexibly later on. And second, Gingrich recognized what many of his predecessors didn’t: that the goal of a modern leader was not necessarily (and in fact, rarely) to work civilly with the other party, but to beat them into submission politically. His “raise hell” approach to both leading and legislating introduced a new level of confrontational politics with implications we continue to live with today.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Whereas Gingrich’s revolutionary leadership came in the form of remaking his party politically and amending specific House rules to leadership’s advantage, Senator Mitch McConnell’s influence has come primarily from breaking long-adhered-to norms in the US Senate. Unlike Gingrich, McConnell is a vocally understated politician rather than a blustering or barnstorming campaigner. But this characteristic only enhanced his pathbreaking tenure as Majority Leader in the Senate from 2015 to 2021. One <i>Washington Post</i> op-ed following the 2020 election called McConnell “the most important Republican since Ronald Reagan.”<sup><a class="note-link" href="#s9781071841471.i2067" id="s9781071841471.i1903">28</a></sup> McConnell’s key insight into the accumulation and retention of power in Congress is that many of the restraints that members and their party leaders face are not ones built into the Constitution, but rather are chamber rules that can be bent, broken, or changed if it serves partisan interest. Or, in the norm-dependent Senate, they are simply traditions that, if ignored at the correct time, can yield tremendous political and policy windfalls for those willing to do so.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">McConnell’s most legendary—and for Democrats, infuriating—efforts in this arena came in the form of influence over the federal courts, where the Senate plays a key role in affirming or denying the President’s nominees. McConnell’s moment came in early 2016 following the unexpected passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, a stalwart conservative voice on the Supreme Court. But while Democrats saw a golden opportunity to appoint a third left-leaning justice during the Obama administration, McConnell had other ideas. Using his Republican majority, McConnell did not just refuse to confirm Obama’s nominee, circuit court judge Merrick Garland. He refused to even hold a hearing on Garland’s nomination, much less hold a vote of any kind. McConnell did this, he argued, because of the upcoming election. “The American people are perfectly capable of having their say on this issue,” McConnell told reporters, “so let’s give them a voice. Let’s let the American people decide.” McConnell’s gambit, like Gingrich’s, paid off. Republican Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election later that year, and McConnell helped to confirm his conservative nominee, Neil Gorsuch, early in Trump’s term in office.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="162"></span>Despite his democratically infused proclamations, most commentators understand that McConnell’s actions in this area had less to do with establishing norms about election-year court nominations, but rather about breaking old norms about the Senate’s deference to the President in order to accumulate power and achieve policy wins for his party. This became especially clear four years later when a court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s death just two months before the 2020 election was promptly filled without objection from the Majority Leader.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">No discussion about party leaders in Congress—particularly the modern Congress—can persist without considering the legacy of Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). While most Americans know her first and foremost as the pathbreaking first female speaker in American history, Pelosi’s rise both before and within Congress is emblematic of how party-focused the legislative branch is. Pelosi’s recognition of this fact, and subsequent mastery of the House of Representatives, constitutes one of her many major accomplishments as a leader in Congress. Her pre-congressional career included rising through the ranks as a Democratic National Committee member from California, Chair of the California Democratic Party, and finance chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in the 1980s. By putting in her time and demonstrating her stature as a loyal party soldier throughout her first several terms in Congress, Pelosi quickly rose through the leadership ranks and wielded significant influence in major policy initiatives during the first two years of the Obama administration. In her first term as speaker, Pelosi marshaled a sprawling Democratic caucus in the House to pass administration priorities such as a vast economic stimulus package, cap-and-trade environmental legislation, new Wall Street financial regulations, and Obama’s landmark Affordable Care Act healthcare legislation with overriding support from her caucus. Her command of power and procedure in the House were evident throughout.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Widely acknowledged as an adept vote counter and prolific party fundraiser, Pelosi also demonstrated her enormous skill at “picking her spots” as a party leader and creating the most opportunities for her party to have as much policy influence as possible. Following President Bush’s 2004 reelection, for example, many activist Democrats were supportive of articles of impeachment against the president based on assertions that he misled Congress and the public on the issue of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and other misdeeds stemming from the “War on Terror” following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Pelosi quickly shut down these calls, both as minority leader in 2006, and early on in her speakership in 2007, recognizing that for Democrats to win the White House and enact bold progressive legislation under unified government, they could not be seen as overreaching or engaging in overtly partisan activity. She showed the same political shrewdness in the opposite situation in early 2021, recognizing that a significant majority of the American people held President Trump at least <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="163"></span>partly responsible for the insurrection that took place at the US Capitol at the end of his presidency, and successfully pushed through articles of impeachment that resulted in the most bipartisan conviction vote in congressional history. In taking stock of both her policy accomplishments under the Obama and Biden administrations, and her political acumen in knowing when to go on the offensive, Pelosi is arguably the most powerful woman in American political history.</p>

<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When Americans think of parties and partisanship in Congress, they often think of vociferous floor speeches, prickly quotations in the press, or major individual figures beloved by one side, or despised by the other. Rarely do they think about what benefit—tangible, electoral, or political—parties provide their members or their voters. They do not often think of agenda control, committee assignments, or even whipping votes for major legislation. This is in part because parties and partisanship, while endemic to our larger American political life, often fly under the radar in terms of the broader structural effects they have on Congress and how it operates, both procedurally and politically. We have learned in this chapter that parties have nearly always had a significant influence on how Congress works and the types of representation that are achieved there. But we have also learned how parties have changed over time, and how these changes are deeply intertwined with, rather than separate from, changes in Congress as an institution. In Congress as in other political institutions, the power of parties can be abused by those already in positions of privilege and power; they can also be invaluable vehicles of representation for those who traditionally go underrepresented.</p>
<p xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xmlns:r="http://www.rsuitecms.com/rsuite/ns/metadata" xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The many ways in which the two parties and their leaders are influential in Congress remain hotly debated by commentators and political scientists alike. We have come a long way from Madison’s and the other founders’ assertions about the dangers of political parties and partisanship, though there is wisdom in these and other more modern theories of how parties structure congressional action. One particularly useful lens through which we can analyze parties in the contemporary Congress is that of power and progress. The historical lessons of this chapter show us that parties are the way members of Congress band together to accumulate power and use it to achieve their political and policy goals. Progressive partisan factions in Congress can lead to monumental eras of progressive legislation. Reactionary parties looking to reassert legislative control can do so under the right political circumstances. Long-simmering ideological polarization between the two parties can only stay out of Congress for so long, and when it no longer can, newly powerful party leaders are there to organize, and even take advantage of, the chaos. The centrality of parties was covered so early in this book because of how central they are to all other lawmaking and representational aspects of how Congress operates. Readers will notice that parties are not simply <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="164"></span>collectively acting organizations within the chamber, but rather are well integrated into committee activity, the policymaking process, and relations with other branches of government.</p>
