	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> You decide to give Jennifer, your Chief of Staff, a call.</p><br>

	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and Jennifer:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Hi. Jennifer, thanks for speaking with me. I’d like to discuss your feedback regarding the metrics I presented on the HRIT System.</p>
	<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> OK.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, I understand that you want us to revise the metrics, but I am confident that they are the right measures to demonstrate the ROI of the System. We put a lot of time into developing the evaluation plan and I am certain that this is the way to go.</p>
	<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> I understand how you feel given all the work you’ve done on this project, but this evaluation plan won’t work for the report we need to submit to the Department of Federal Audit and Compliance. The metrics you presented won’t suffice and I need you to change them. Please send me your revisions as soon as possible. </p>
