<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> A few weeks later you begin to hear concerning rumors about your project. A few of your trusted colleagues have reported they’ve overheard people saying that you are doing a poor job managing the HRIT System, as it keeps running into problems. They don’t believe the data in the system is accurate, and are saying that you are wasting the agency’s time and money—that the project is doomed to fail. You are just starting to build momentum and these rumors might cause more than a few setbacks.</p>
	<p>What’s your strategy for dealing with the rumors?</p>
