	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and the Deputy Secretary, James:</strong></p>
<p><strong>James:</strong> Hello.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Good afternoon, sir. How are you?</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> I’ve been better. Unfortunately, I don’t have good news to share. The leadership team is concerned about the success of the HRIT System. What we’ve been hearing is troubling, and since you only have 4 months left until the end of the fiscal year, we’re just not confident that you can accomplish the goal in time.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> I’m sorry you’re having doubts, but I assure you that we are headed in the right direction and we will launch the System successfully and on time. We have had a few setbacks, but we’ll be saving a lot of time and money in the long run. If we can set up a time to meet, I have some figures that will alleviate your concerns.</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> OK, let’s meet in my office at 3 p.m.</p>
