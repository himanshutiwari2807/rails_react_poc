	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and the Deputy Secretary, James:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Good afternoon, sir. How are you?</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> I’ve been better. Unfortunately, I don’t have good news to share. The leadership team is concerned about the success of the HRIT System. What we’ve been hearing is troubling, and since you only have 4 months left until the end of the fiscal year, we’re just not confident that you can accomplish the goal in time.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> I’m sorry you’re having doubts, but I assure you that we are headed in the right direction and will launch the System successfully and on time.</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> I’m not so sure.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, in order to show you how much progress we’ve made, I’ve created a dashboard that shows our progress compared to other offices in our department. As you will see, despite our setbacks, we are much closer to completion that any of the other teams.</p>
