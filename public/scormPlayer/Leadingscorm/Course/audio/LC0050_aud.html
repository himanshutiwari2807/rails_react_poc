	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> During the meeting, you state your vision.</p>

	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Your team hesitates initially, but agrees that this is a vision they can all support and implement if they collaborate. They work together to design a Project Plan that meets the 6-month timeframe. Meanwhile, as you are busy assessing your resources to ensure you have everything you need to be successful, you get a voicemail from Lisa.</p>

	<p><strong>Voicemail from Lisa:</strong><br>Hi, it’s Lisa. Just calling to say, “Excellent job!” Because this system has many moving parts that will impact the agency as a whole, it’s important to ensure your team understands the vision and has an opportunity to weigh in before you get started.</p>
