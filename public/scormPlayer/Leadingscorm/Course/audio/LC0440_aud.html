<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> You send Shannon an email saying that your team does not have the capacity to link the retirement data. Shortly after you send the email, Shannon calls your office.</p>

	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and Shannon:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Hi, Shannon, what can I do for you?</p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> I’m confused about your email. I’m not sure what the issue is. Surely there is someone on your team that can work on linking the retirement data. </p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> I’m sorry, but we just can’t do it. We are already doing everything we can to make sure we meet the deadline as it is. We are simply spread too thin. If we add anything else at this point, we won’t be able to complete the project on time.</p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> You need to figure out a way to make this work. Have you discussed the idea with your team?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> No, I didn’t want to cause them any unnecessary stress.</p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> I understand your concerns, but it is your job to ensure this system is the best that it can be, and adding the retirement data will add value. Talk to your team and figure out a way to make this happen.</p>

	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> The next morning, you receive an email from Shannon.</p>
