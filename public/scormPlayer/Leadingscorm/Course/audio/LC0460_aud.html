	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> You send Shannon an email telling her that you appreciate her idea, but that you would like to gather more information from your team to develop a plan for integrating the data. You call a team meeting to discuss the issue.</p>

	<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> You send Shannon an email saying that you will link the retirement data. That afternoon, you receive an email from Leo.</p>

	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and Shannon:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> Hi, what can I do for you?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> We’ve run into an issue with the retirement data.</p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> What’s the problem?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, I had my team connect with the Retirement Office and they claim that there is a personnel records policy that prevents us from being able to use their data.</p>
	<p><strong>Shannon:</strong> That’s interesting. Let me see what I can find out.</p>
