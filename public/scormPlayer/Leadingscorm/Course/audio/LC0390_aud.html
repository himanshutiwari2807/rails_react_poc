<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> You decide to give Jennifer, your Chief of Staff, a call.</p><br>

	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and Jennifer:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> Hello?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Hi, Jennifer, thanks for speaking with me. Iâ€™d like to discuss your feedback regarding the metrics I presented on the HRIT System.</p>
	<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> OK.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> First of all, I want to apologize. My team developed the evaluation plan, and after looking it over again I realize that there are mistakes. I just wanted to let you know that I will personally revise this and send it back to you as soon as possible.</p>
	<p><strong>Jennifer:</strong> Your team may have created the metrics, but <em>you</em> are ultimately responsible for ensuring that your department submits quality metrics for the system. Thank you for calling. I look forward to your revisions.</p>
