	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and the Deputy Secretary, James:</strong></p>
<p><strong>You:</strong> Hi, James, thanks for speaking with me on such short notice.</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> Not a problem. What’s going on?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, I’ve heard from one of the managers in my working group that Pay and Benefits has been providing faulty data. This could have a significant impact on our project.</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> I agree. Do you have any evidence to support this claim?</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Well, not yet. But I thought you would want to know as soon as possible.</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> There’s nothing I can do at this point. Let me know when you have more definitive information.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> OK, will do.</p>
