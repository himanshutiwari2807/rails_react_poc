<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Unfortunately, it appears your efforts to dispel the rumors were too little, too late. They’ve reached the Deputy Secretary, and he has confided in Shannon that he’s losing confidence in your ability to manage this project. He wants to speak with you as soon as possible, so make sure you are prepared when he calls.</p>

	<p>How do you prepare for the call with the Deputy Secretary?</p>
