	<p><strong>A phone conversation between you and the Deputy Secretary, James:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> Hello.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> Good afternoon, sir. How are you?</p>
	<p><strong>James:</strong> I’ve been better. Unfortunately, I don’t have good news to share. The leadership team is concerned about the success of the HRIT System. What we’ve been hearing is troubling, and since you only have 4 months left until the end of the fiscal year, we’re just not confident that you can accomplish the goal in time.</p>
	<p><strong>You:</strong> I understand that you’re concerned, but let me remind you that you selected me for this role because of my experience implementing large-scale changes. This is all part of the process. Trust me, this initiative will be a success.</p>
