00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You: Hi, Jason. Thank you for meeting with me.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Jason: No problem. What do you need? 

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You: I just wanted to talk to you about the HRIT System and

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
make sure we have everything you need to support the project.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Jason: Actually, I don’t. Ever since the mix-up with the pay data, 

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
no one on the working group takes me seriously. I don’t even want to

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
be a part of it anymore, to be honest, but I really don’t have a choice.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You: I want you to know that I don’t blame you for the pay data.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Everyone makes mistakes, and it was an easy fix! We value your expertise and

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
perspective as a part of the team, and I apologize if it doesn’t feel that way.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Is there anything I can do to change your mind?

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Jason: Actually, I’m surprised you’re not still upset about the data.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Would you be able to attend the next working group meeting and vouch that the new

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
pay data is accurate? I triple-checked it before we loaded it into the system.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You: Consider it done.
