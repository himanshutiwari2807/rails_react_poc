Nina: You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You: Hi! Yes, come in.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
As you know, the purchase request has been approved by the CFO, but Shannon

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
put a halt on the process. She’s concerned that it is not a cost-effective solution.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I’m confident that we have enough justification to purchase the system, but I’d

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
like for someone with more technical expertise to meet with Shannon to make the case.

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Would you be willing to meet with her and address her concerns?

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Nina: I’d be happy to.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You: Great! I’ll connect you via email so you can schedule a time to meet.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Nina: OK. I’ll keep you posted.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You: Please do.
