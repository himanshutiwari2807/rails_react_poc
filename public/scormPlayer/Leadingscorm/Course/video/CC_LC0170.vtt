Max: Hey, can we chat for a second?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You: Sure, what’s up?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Max: Well, I want to talk to you about something I just heard.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Nina told me that she suspects one of our Pay and Benefits contacts— 

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Jason—has been providing faulty data.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Someone highlighted a discrepancy during our last working group meeting

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and Jason was furious. He denied the claim and stormed out of the meeting.
