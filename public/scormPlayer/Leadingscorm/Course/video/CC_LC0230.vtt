Brian: What’s up?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You: Hey, Brian, do you have time for a quick chat? 

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Brian: Sure, what do you need?

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You: Well, it’s about the rumors. I know we talked about this earlier in the week,

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but it’s unsettling how much false information is out there.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I’m afraid this might jeopardize the future of the project.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Brian: I hear you.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You: So I have a favor to ask. I need help spreading positive information

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about the System highlighting all of the progress that’s been made. 

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here’s some data on our current progress and expected benefits of the System; 

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you can see that it will save managers an estimated 2 hours a week 

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on administrative tasks. This will save us so much time in the long run.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Brian: This is great information! I’d be happy to help you out.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You: Thanks, I appreciate it!
