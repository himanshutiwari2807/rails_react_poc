00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
What can I help you with?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.500
I’d like to discuss the purchase of the IT upgrade.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.620
I know you have concerns, and I’d like to talk through them

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.100
so you can see that this software is a critical need.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.400
I assure you that the long-term benefits outweigh the initial cost.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200
OK. That sounds fair. I’m curious to hear what you have to say.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Tick tick tick... The meeting runs for 30 minutes. 

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At the end of the meeting, Shannon gives her approval.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500
It sounds like this upgrade is a strategic move.

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
I will approve the purchase request. 

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Thank you for giving me a call—I’m excited for this System to launch!
