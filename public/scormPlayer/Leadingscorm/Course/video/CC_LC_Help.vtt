00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Leading Change, a simulation designed to help you better 

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
manage and facilitate organizational change in your office.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This course is meant to emulate your office environment; as you can see,

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you have a desk, a computer, a smart phone, and an office door.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Please note that on some devices, you may have to scroll down the page

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to see all of the content. As you progress through the simulation, 

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you will get emails, text messages, voicemails, IMs, and

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in-person visits from members of your team.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
[door - knock sound]

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Team member: Your wanted to see me?

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Throughout the course, you’ll face challenges, make decisions, and interact

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with your team members. No matter what you sound like in real life,

13
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the following is what your voice will sound like during the simulation:

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You: Hi! Yes, come in. As you know, the purchase request

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
has been approved by the CFO, but Shannon put a halt on the process. 

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Your decisions will prompt various conversations between you

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
(the executive) and your coworkers.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You want the project to be successful,so choose wisely!

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The main menu is located in the bottom right corner of the screen.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This consists of: the Closed Captions button, the Transcript button,

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the Help button, the Resources button, and Exit.

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The CC button will turn on closed captioning for all video animations

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the course. Just select the button and answer the question with "Okay."

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This turns on captioning for all the videos in the course. To turn captioning off, 

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
select the button again, and again select "Okay."

26
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The Transcript button will appear only on screens where there is audio

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
content that isn't included as screen text. Selecting the Transcript button

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
will offer a record of that audio content for you to read. In order to view the 

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
transcript and other popups, you must turn off your browser’s popup blocker.

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If you need assistance turning off your popup blocker,

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
contact your system administrator.

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you won't be checking the transcript on each screen where it appears,

33
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
please make sure you have working speakers or headphones, and that your

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
computer’s audio is turned on! There is essential information in the simulation

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(received through voicemails, narration, and phone calls, for example)

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that is not covered in the onscreen text; and you'll miss out 

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
if your speakers are turned off.

38
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If you need to refresh your memory about the course functionality,

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the Help button will launch the video you're watching now, in a separate window.

40
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The Resources button will launch a selection of two printable documents:

41
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
your project mission and a description of your team members. 

42
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Selecting the Exit button will close the course. If you exit without completing 

43
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the course, your progress will be saved. You will be able to continue from

44
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
your last completed screen when you return. However, we do recommend

45
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that you complete this simulation in one sitting.

46
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The Next and Back buttons will allow you to progress to the next screen,

47
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
or go back to a previous screen. On some screens, the Next button may be

48
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
disabled until you complete the on-screen instructions,

49
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
which are always located here in the black bar at the bottom of your screen.

50
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
For instance, these instructions read: "Select your computer to learn more."

51
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You have now completed the Navigation tutorial!
