You: Good morning, everyone. I have some news to share.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Shannon has asked that we link retirement data to the system, and

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I’d like to discuss your thoughts on how we can get this done.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Leo: Well, this is a surprise.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At this late stage, I’m not sure how we’d be able to get it done.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We’d have to do some major re-work on the System to do what she’s asking.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Claire: I agree. To accommodate this new addition, we will end up

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
compromising the quality of the system in the end.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You: Unfortunately, we don’t have a choice.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I am confident that you will be able to get it done without sacrificing quality.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Nina: Time is the issue here! There is just no extra room in our project

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
timeline to get this done. We would have to shortcut other critical aspects

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of the project in order to meet the deadline.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You: Once again, I’m sure you guys can figure out how to make this work.
