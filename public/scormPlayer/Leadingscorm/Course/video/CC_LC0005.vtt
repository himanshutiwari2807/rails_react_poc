00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to the Leading Change simulation!

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here, you will practice your leadership skills

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
by leading an organization through a significant transition.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Leading Change is one of the five

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs),

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and it involves the ability to bring about

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
strategic change, both within and outside the organization,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to meet organizational goals.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Inherent to this ECQ is the ability to establish

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
an organizational vision and to implement it

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in a continuously changing environment.

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
As you lead your team through this transition,

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you will need to manage all the aspects

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of your daily office environment: emails [chime], voicemails [chime],

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
text messages [chime], phone calls [ring], and meetings.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The difficult decisions you make will impact your team,

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
your relationship with your supervisor,

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and the outcome of an important initiative.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Secretary of your Department,

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the Department of Innovation and Technology, or DIT

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
has recently issued her Strategic Plan for the next 4 years,

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and one of her top priorities is to implement

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
a Human Resources Information Technology (HRIT)

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Integration Plan that will transform the agency's outdated

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and inefficient paper-based processes

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to a more streamlined digital-based approach.

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The goal of this initiative is to capitalize on

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the advancements in technology to automate all HR processes

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and give employees access and control over their data.

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The Secretary has appointed you as the

31
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Executive Director of the newly established

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Office of Human Resources and Technology (OHRT)

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to lead this change effort. You have been allocated a budget

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of $1.5 million to complete the HRIT Integration Plan,

35
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which includes the development of an online HRIT System

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that will capture information on each of

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the agency's 6,500 employees. There is a tight timeline,

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
as the end of the fiscal year

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
will put a halt to all Web development.

40
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
You have 6 months to launch this system.

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
While you manage multiple teams and multiple projects

42
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in this role, your specific challenge here

43
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
is to lead the HRIT System Team to success.

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Be sure to check your email and voicemail,

45
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and read over any other materials that you find.

46
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then you'll be ready to meet your team. Let's get started!

47
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
A copy of your mission is available in Resources

48
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
if you'd like to keep it open for your reference.
