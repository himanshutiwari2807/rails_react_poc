You: Hi, Jack. Thanks for making the time to speak with me.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Jack: Not a problem. I know that you wanted to talk about the required report

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for your new system, but I’m still not aware of why you wanted to meet.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You: Yes. I understand that there’s a report due next week for all major agency

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
IT Systems Operations. However, we are currently in the middle of developing

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
an agency-wide HRIT System. I know DFAC has mandated a complete report,

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but that won’t be possible until after our system has launched.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Can you help me understand the requirements better and discuss the

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
possibility of giving you a report on the data we currently have?

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then we could provide periodic updates until we complete the System.

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Jack: I didn’t realize that you were in the middle of such a large-scale project.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I can understand the need to modify the report schedule,

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and your proposal makes sense. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

14
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You: Thanks for your flexibility! I appreciate it.
