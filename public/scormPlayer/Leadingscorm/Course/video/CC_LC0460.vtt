00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You: Good morning, everyone. I have some news to share.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Shannon has asked that we link retirement data to the system, and

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I’d like to discuss your thoughts on how we can get this done.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Leo: Well, this is a surprise.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At this late stage, I’m not sure how we’d be able to get it done.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We’d have to do some major re-work on the System to do what she’s asking.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Claire: I agree. To accommodate this new addition, we will end up

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
compromising the quality of the System in the end.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You: OK, I know you all have been working hard as it is to meet the deadline.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It sounds like time is the biggest issue here.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What if we loaded the retirement data at a later date?

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Leo: Well, sure, that wouldn’t be a problem.

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We need to focus all of our attention on getting the system up and running,

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but once it’s launched, we’ll have all the time we need to phase in extra data.

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You: OK. I’ll propose that we phase the retirement data into the system

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
at a later date. If you could prepare a brief justification for this new 

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
phased approach, along with a modified project plan including new dates for

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the retirement data addition, I’ll have everything I need to make the case.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Leo: Sounds like a plan.
