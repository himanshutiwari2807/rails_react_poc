You: I'd like to discuss the purchase of the IT upgrade.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I know you have concerns, and I'd like to talk through them

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so you can see that this software is a critical need.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I assure you that the long-term benefits outweigh the initial cost.

Shannon: Ok. That sounds fair. I'm curious to hear what you have to say.

I will approve the purchase request.
