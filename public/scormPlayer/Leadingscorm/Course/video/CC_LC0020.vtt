00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning! My name is Lisa, and I'll be your sponsor!

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've been with the agency for 25 years and I'm thrilled

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to support you on this exciting initiative.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'd like to fill you in on a few things about the current

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
work environment, specifically your project team.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
All of your managers are competent

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and skilled in their areas of expertise,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but they've never worked on the same team before.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
While your team understands and appreciates the need for the new office,

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
they've been struggling to determine their new roles

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and responsibilities, and have been voicing their concerns

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about the new project. It's important that everyone works together

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to make this a success, and based on what I've heard about you-

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you're just the right person for the job!

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
As you proceed, you'll need to consider a number of factors

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that are important to leading a change initiative,

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
like: How will you gather resources?

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
How will you manage your direct reports? Your peers?

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And how will you manage the expectations of your leadership?

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You'll also have to consider your budget

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and how to handle budget constraints.

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's important to realize that when managing any kind of

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
change initiative, multiple factors are always at play.

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'll check in with you periodically to see how you're doing

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and provide support if needed.
