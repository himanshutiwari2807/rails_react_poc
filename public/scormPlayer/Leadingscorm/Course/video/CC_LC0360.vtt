Nina: Hi, do you have a moment to talk about the upgrade?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You: Sure.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Nina: I understand that Shannon has concerns about the cost of the software,

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but I don’t think she understands how critical it is to the success of the system.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We’ll need to purchase it eventually, and we’re going to regret holding off.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It will cause a lot of headaches to install it on the back end

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
after the system goes live.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You: I hear what you’re saying, but Shannon knows what she’s doing.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
She has a different perspective than we do, and at this point in time,

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the upgrade isn’t necessary.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Nina: Based on her response to the purchase request,

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it looks like she just needs more information to justify the cost.

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I can put something together if you think that will change her mind.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You: Thank you for offering, but I don’t think that will be necessary.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We need to just move forward as planned without the upgrade.
