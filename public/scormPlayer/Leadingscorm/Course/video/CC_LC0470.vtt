Claire: Hi, you wanted to see us?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You: Good morning, everyone. We just received a mandate from DFAC.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They are requiring all agencies to assess their IT System Operations

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and provide a status update in the form of a detailed report.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Our HRIT System is listed in the directive.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Leo: When is the report due?

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You: In 2 weeks. I need you to start working on it as soon as possible.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Claire: I’m a little confused. We could put together a report, but

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it wouldn’t be complete. The system hasn’t even launched yet, so we

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
couldn’t even address things like testing, certification, and accreditation.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Leo: Claire’s right. Is there a way we can get an extension until after we’ve

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
launched the System, or can we figure out an alternative solution?

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You: I’m not sure. Let me see what I can do.
