00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Capitalizing on the integration of HR and IT is a smart strategic move

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that will provide great value to the agency and a great model for the 

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
rest of the Federal Government. My vision for the HRIT System is a platform 

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that captures information on each aspect of our employees’ Federal careers.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This System will process information on recruitment, performance management,

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
career movements, training and development, and pay and benefits. 

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
By combining all your knowledge and expertise in HR and IT,

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we’ll be able to set the gold standard for Human Resources in government.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What are your thoughts? I want to be sure we all agree on this vision.
