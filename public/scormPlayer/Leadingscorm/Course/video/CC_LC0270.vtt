00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
You: Hi, Jason. Thank you for meeting with me.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Jason: No problem. What do you need?

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You: Well, I have been hearing some upsetting rumors about the HRIT project, and

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what’s even more concerning is that I’ve been led to believe they started with you.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Jason: Hold on a minute—you think I’ve been spreading rumors about the project?

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is ridiculous—what proof do you have?

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You: I’ve had multiple sources name you as the instigator, and the lies need to

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
stop now. If this continues, I promise I will take it up with the Chief of Staff.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can’t let you jeopardize my project.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Jason: I can’t believe this. I didn’t do anything wrong.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Don’t ever ask me or my team for help again!
