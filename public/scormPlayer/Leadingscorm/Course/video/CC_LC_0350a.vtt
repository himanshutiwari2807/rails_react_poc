Nina: Hi, you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You: Yes. As you know, Shannon put a halt on the purchase of the upgrade.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She's concerned that it is not a cost-effective solution.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to meet with Shannon to address her concerns,

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but I need more facts about the software.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Can you compile a few data points that highlight the benefits of the upgrade

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and how it will help us accomplish our vision?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We need to justify the cost, and the more information I have, the better.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Nina: Sure, I'll draft something and send it over as soon as possible.

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You: Sounds good.
