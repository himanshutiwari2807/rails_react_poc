Nina: Hi, you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You: Yes. As you know, Shannon put a halt on the purchase of the upgrade.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
She's concerned that it is not a cost-effective solution.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to meet with Shannon to address her concerns, but I need more

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
facts about the software. Can you compile a few data points that highlight

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the benefits of the upgrade and how it will help us accomplish our vision?

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We need to justify the cost, and the more information I have, the better.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Nina: Sure, I'll draft something and send it over as soon as possible.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You: Sounds good.
